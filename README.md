# MediConnnect
A user-friendly web application to simplify healthcare appointments, information, and resources. Developed for the Google Developer Solution Challenge 2023.
Made using HTML,CSS,JS,Express.js,Node.js,EJS,Google Maps Platform, and bootstrap for CSS.

## Functionality : 
1.Appointment Booking: Streamlined scheduling for healthcare consultations.
2. Health Information: Access to reliable medical resources and articles.
3. Provider Search: Find doctors, specialists, and hospitals by location or specialty.
4. Secure Messaging: (If applicable) HIPAA-compliant communication with providers.
5. There is not a database attached to the app, so everytime you restart the server, the list will reset.
6. The Project isn't complete. We tried implementing google maps api platform into our project but it isn't exactly correct.
7. The Make appointments functionality isn't completed yet. We'll be implementing it very soon.
